# Modules and Libraries
Each module of python-SAT is containerized into these folders.

We seperate the libraries in this manner in order to maintain organization,
as ideally we want to make our code as modular as possible. 

In versions 1.2.5+, each library will contain a readme.md file to explain
each libraries function to the program, and will include information on
how dependencies interact with one another in the project.
